# DataViz

Hi, I'm Sarah Boyle and I am a Junior at [**Lehigh University**](http://www1.lehigh.edu/) double majoring in Journalism and Politcal Science.  
I am currentlly enrolled in a seven and half week course where I hope to learn and be able to apply data visualization in my future journalism endeavors.  I hope to learn a great deal about conveying a story through data, and strengthen my reporting skills.
